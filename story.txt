This story is about a man named James. He loves baseball and really enjoys
playing his guitar. He attends the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,
studying computer science. James is a proud Gopher and heavily dislikes the Badgers.

One day, a Badger arrived to the Twin Cities, to James's disdain. As they got off
the freeway and onto campus, the Badger poked their head out of their window and
started shouting "Minnesota is bad! Go Badgers! Safety school!"

James ran after the bus and flagged it down. After boarding the bus, he confronted the Badger.
"Badgers and Gophers can live in harmony," James said as he stuck out his hand for a handshake.
The Gopher and Badger became friends.
