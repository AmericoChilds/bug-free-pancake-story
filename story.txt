This story is about a man named James. He loves baseball and really enjoys
playing his guitar. He attends the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,
studying computer science. James is a proud Gopher and heavily dislikes the Badgers.

One day, a Badger arrived to the Twin Cities, to James's disdain. As they got off
the freeway and onto campus, the Badger poked their head out of their window and
started shouting "Minnesota is bad! Go Badgers! Safety school!"

James ran after the bus and flagged it down. After boarding the bus, he confronted the Badger.
"Badgers and Gophers can live in harmony," James said as he stuck out his hand for a handshake.
The Gopher and Badger became friends.

It was at this point that the Badger broke the fourth wall, asking "what does this dumb story have to do with bug-free pancakes anyways?"
The Badger then pulled out a stack of pancakes covered in scorpions from his pockets. To ensure that the pancakes were "bug-free" indeed, he picked the
venomous scorpions up from the tail and threw them at James' face. James was
stung repeatedly, went into shock and died as the Badger enjoyed his delicious bug-free pancakes.

The death of James started the 10 year long Big-10 war. Gopher students were outraged, but many Badgers didn't see it as a big deal.
Many lives were lost in the tragedy and the relationship between the Twin Cities and Madison would never be the same.
